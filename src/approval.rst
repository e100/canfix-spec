.. _Approval Process:

Update and Approval Process
===========================

Suggested updates to this specification will be made via the MakerPlane CAN-FiX
online forum.  http://makerplane.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=24.

The CAN-FiX Specification Review Committee (CFSRC) will consist of a minimum of
two voting members.  This Committee is charged with gathering change requests,
seeking consensus on those changes and approving the changes for implementation
within the next version of the specification.   Other requirements and processes
are to be advised.  At a period of not less than twice per year, the Committee
will meet to formally discuss and approve changes to the specification.

These change requests will be discussed and either approved for ratification by
the specification committee, not approved, or reserved for further discussion by
the moderator of the CAN-FiX forum.

The CFSRC will operate within the following essential guidelines [#f1]_ :

* Openness.  Participation shall be open to all persons who are directly and
  materially affected by the activity in question.  There shall be no financial
  barriers to participation.  Timely and accurate notice of any action to revise,
  reaffirm or withdraw this specification shall be made via the MakerPlane forum.
  All specifications are to be released as Open Source under a Creative Commons
  Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license.

* Lack of Dominance.  This specification process shall not be dominated by any
  single interest category, individual or organization.  Dominance means a
  position or exercise of dominant authority, leadership, or influence by reason
  of superior leverage, strength, or representation to the exclusion of fair and
  equitable consideration of other viewpoints. No test for dominance is required
  unless it is claimed in writing (including electronically) by a directly and
  materially affected party that  single interest category, individual or
  organization dominated the specification development or change process.

* Consideration of Views and Objections.  Prompt consideration shall be given
  to the written views and objections of all participants.

* Consensus Vote and Appeals.  We will provide documented evidence of consensus
  vote for each change request.  Procedural appeals include whether a technical
  issue was afforded due process and will be supported with evidence.  This can
  simply be a record of yea vs. nae votes during ratification proceedings.
