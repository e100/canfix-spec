Recommended Practices
=====================

The information in this chapter is not a requirement to be compliant with this
specification.  Rather, simply a list of recommendations that help to simplify
and standardize the implementation of the specification.  This makes it easier
on the developer, because typical mistakes can be avoided and it makes it
easier on the end user, because things will work together more easily.
