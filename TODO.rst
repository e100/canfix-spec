 ToDo List

   * Create a Makefile to automatically convert SVG files to PNG
   * Add better description of how to build the documents
   * Add note about the official location of the specification (GitHub?)
   * Also change the document itself to reflect that.
   * Add Node Specific Parameter Change functionality
   * Remove the varios ...Set parameters.  They are replaced by the above function
   * Add requirement for nodes to periodically send something once every 2000 mSec
   * Add parameter "Aircraft Type" at ID=1416 CHAR[4]
   * Device description mechanism.  Probably another Node Specific message that
     would be packet based.  First two bytes are packet number then four bytes
     of information.  Zero terminated string.  Might add a recomendation for
     what the string should look like.
   * Add Tach time
   * Serial number reporting?  Another Node Status Information??
   * Add Logo
   * Fix ADS-B Stuff
